# Submarine Danger Prediction

## Overview
The Submarine Danger Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model using logistic regression to predict potential dangers for submarines based on various environmental and operational data. The goal is to enhance submarine safety by anticipating threats such as underwater obstacles, hazardous weather conditions, and enemy detection.
